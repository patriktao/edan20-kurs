        <title>Assignment #3: Language detection</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!--<h1>Assignment #3: Extracting noun groups using machine learning techniques</h1>-->
        <p>In this assignment, you will implement a language detector inspired from Google's <i>Compact language
            detector</i>, version 3 (CLD3): https://github.com/google/cld3.
            CLD3 is written in C++ and its code is available from GitHub.
        </p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The objectives of the assignment are to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write a program to classify languages</li>
            <li>Use neural networks</li>
            <li>Know what a classifier is</li>
            <li>Write a short report of 1 to 2 pages to describe your program. You will notably comment the performance
                you obtained and how you could improve it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Organization and location</h2>

        <p>You can work alone or collaborate with another student.</p>
        <p>Each group will have to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write a Python program.</li>
            <li>Check the results and comment them briefly</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Content of the lab</h2>
        <p>
            The text of the lab is in the language detector notebook available here
            <a href="https://github.com/pnugues/edan20/tree/master/notebooks">

        </p>
        <h2>Turning in the assignment</h2>
        <p>When are done with the program and to complete the assignment, you will:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write a short individual report on your program. Do not forget to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Summarize CLD3 and outline its architecture</li>
                    <li>Identify the features used by CLD3</li>
                    <li>Include the feature matrix you computed manually</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will submit your report as well as your notebook (for archiving purposes) to Canvas:
            <a href="https://canvas.education.lu.se/">https://canvas.education.lu.se/</a>. To write your report, you can
            either:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write directly your text in Canvas, or</li>
            <li>Use Latex and Overleaf (<a href="https://www.overleaf.com">https://www.overleaf.com</a>). This will
                probably help you structure your text. You will
                then upload a PDF file in Canvas.
            </li>
        </ol>
